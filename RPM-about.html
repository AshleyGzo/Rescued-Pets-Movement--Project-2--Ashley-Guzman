            <h1>About Rescued Pets Movement</h1>
            <p>Tragically, thousands of homeless dogs and cats are needlessly euthanized in the Greater Houston area each year simply because of pet overpopulation. Rescued Pets Movement Inc. is a 501c3 organization that provides a second chance for thousands of homeless dogs and cats through rescue, rehabilitation and transport to forever homes in communities throughout the United States that have a demand for adoptable pets.</p>

                <p>Since starting operations in late 2013, Rescued Pets Movement has saved the lives of nearly <b>73,000</b> homeless companion animals by rescuing them from area shelters and transporting them to their new forever homes via our reputable rescue partners across the U.S.</p>

                 <p>After working with various traditional rescue groups for many years, the founders of Rescued Pets Movement realized that the best way to save these dogs and cats is to get them out of Houston to other parts of the US where there was actually a demand for homeless animals.  By partnering with other reputable rescue groups, we knew we could save thousands of more animals than by adopting them out locally.</p>

                <p>After RPM rescues animals from area shelters, the dogs and cats need short-termfoster homes until their transport date. We are constantly in need of fosters and donations to cover their extraordinary medical costs to make sure every pet transported is healthy.</p>
